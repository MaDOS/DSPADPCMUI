# DSPADPCMUI
A DSPADPCM UI wrapper for the Gamecube SDK which also converts the input wav into a dsp convertable 16bit wav automatically. 

Download is available directly from the [bin/Release](https://github.com/MaDOS/DSPADPCMUI/blob/master/bin/Release/) folder. I reccomend downloading the [.zip](https://github.com/MaDOS/DSPADPCMUI/blob/master/bin/Release/Release.zip) file.

This will convert nearly any wav file to a dsp convertable 16 bit 11025 bitrate wav file and then use dspadpcm to convert it into a dsp.

---

**Installation:**
This programm has to be in one directory with dspadpcm.exe, dsptool.dll and soundfile.dll found in the Gamecube SDK. It also needs a custom NAudio.dll which it should ship with.

---

**Usage:**
Browse for an input *.wav file and specify an out *.dsp file then click convert. Done.
